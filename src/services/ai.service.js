   - Summary: Brief 1-2 sentence assessment of the code quality and primary concerns

2. DETAILED ANALYSIS:
   - Critical Issues: High-priority problems requiring immediate attention (security vulnerabilities, logic errors, performance bottlenecks)
   - Code Quality: Assessment of readability, maintainability, and adherence to conventions
   - Architecture: Evaluation of overall design patterns and structural choices

3. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Each issue should include:
     ‚Ä¢ üîç Problem description
     ‚Ä¢ üí° Solution with optimized code example
     ‚Ä¢ üîÑ Before/After comparison when applicable

4. OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:
   - Performance enhancements
   - Memory usage improvements
   - Algorithmic optimizations

5. BEST PRACTICES:
   - Language-specific recommendations
   - Design pattern suggestions
   - Testing considerations

6. LEARNING RESOURCES:
   - Documentation references
   - Relevant articles or tutorials
   - Tool recommendations

Format your review with clear visual hierarchy using markdown for readability, with code examples properly formatted in code blocks.
